# AM I DOWN

Simple HTTP status checking service, which can itself be tied to an even simpler service like Uptime Robot. In keeping with the spirit of infrastructure as code, all config is stored as text (JSON) files, and the service itself is fully Dockerized.

## Vagrant

Vagrant will scaffold up a full dev runtime in a VM, and is my preferred way of managing project setup. This project was confirmed working on Vagrant 2.2.4 and VirtualBox 6.0.6.

To use

- cd vagrant
- vagrant up
- vagrant ssh

## Setup

- create settings.json, use src/settings-example.json as example. Add sites you want to test. Set sane poll intervals. Adds email addresses of people who need to be alerted.
- create flags folder, 
- chown 1000 -R flags
- if you want to persists logs, create logs folder and chown as above
- use docker/docker-compose-yml as base for your docker-compose file.
